    <h2>Introduction</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>Australia's economic landscape is shaped by the diverse strengths and resources of its states and territories. From bustling urban centers to resource-rich regions, each state contributes uniquely to the nation's overall economic performance. We begin by examining the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of each state, providing an initial snapshot of their economic standings.</p>

    <h2>New South Wales and Victoria:  Economic Powerhouses in Australia</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>The GDP data reveals that New South Wales, Victoria are among the top economic performers, with GDPs of 777,299 million and 568,866 million respectively, followed by Queensland with GDPs of 503,351 million. These states dominate the country's economy, showing significantly higher GDPs compared to other regions.</p>

    <h2>Victoria and New South Wales: Education and Service Sectors</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>The educational income data reveals a clear dominance of New South Wales and Victoria with these states generating significantly higher income from education exports compared to other regions.This suggests that these states have robust educational systems that contribute significantly to their economies, likely due to their large number of higher education institutions and attractiveness to <b>both domestic and international students</b>. All states experienced a dip in 2021, but recovered by 2023, indicating resilience in their education sectors.</p>

    <h2>Tourism's Impact on State Economies</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>The 2024 tourism data reveals interesting patterns, with New South Wales receiving the highest number of visitors (234,450), followed by Queensland (171,360) and Victoria (161,390). New South Wales leads by a significant margin, likely due to the global popularity of Sydney and its cultural landmarks. Queensland follows closely, known for its natural wonders like the Great Barrier Reef, while Victoria's strong performance can be attributed to Melbourne's status as a cultural and sporting hub.</p>

    <h2>Western Australia’s Surprising Dominance in Exports</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>While New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland are known to dominate in several economic sectors, Western Australia's export performance is surprisingly high, outpacing all other states by a significant margin. This is primarily driven by its exports of <b>minerals and fuels</b>, as shown in the chart. Western Australia’s resource-rich economy, particularly in mining, positions it as a key player in Australia’s overall export landscape.</p>

    <h2>Unveiling Economic Efficiency: GSP per Capita Reveals Other Side of the Coin</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>The normalization of the economic data by GSP per capita reveals a different picture of Australia’s state economies. While initial GDP figures highlighted the dominance of populous states like New South Wales and Victoria, normalized data shows that Western Australia <b>dominates in economic output per person</b>, which is justifiable by its extraordinary exports performance. Interestingly, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory rank second and third despite low economic outputs.</p>

    <h2> Low Population, High Impact: Explaining ACT and NT's GSP per Capita</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory (NT) rank second and third in GSP per capita, largely due to their relatively <b>low populations</b>. As shown in the population data, both territories have much smaller populations compared to the larger states, like New South Wales and Victoria. This explains why they have higher GSP per capita despite having moderate economic outputs. </p>
