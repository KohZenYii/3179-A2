    <h2>Western Australia and Queensland: Resource-Driven Powerhouses</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>The GDP data reveals that Western Australia and Queensland are among the top economic performers, with GDPs of 445,348 million and 503,351 million respectively. This economic strength appears closely tied to their robust export performance, as shown in the 2017-2019 export data where Western Australia significantly outperforms other states. These regions' economies are primarily driven by their rich natural resources, with mining and energy exports playing a crucial role in their economic success.</p>

    <h2>Victoria and New South Wales: Education and Service Sectors</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>Despite having a lower GDP than Western Australia, Victoria shows substantial educational export (income), as evidenced in the 2020-2023 educational export data. New South Wales also demonstrates strong performance in educational exports, suggesting that these states have successfully diversified their economies beyond traditional industries.</p>

    <h2>Tourism's Impact on State Economies</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>The 2024 tourism data reveals interesting patterns, with New South Wales receiving the highest number of visitors (234,450), followed by Queensland (171,360) and Victoria (161,390). This tourism strength provides an additional economic pillar for these states, contributing to their overall economic resilience and diversification. The tourism sector appears to complement other economic activities, particularly in states that may not have the same level of resource exports as Western Australia.</p>

    <h2>The Challenge of Smaller States</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>The data highlights the economic challenges faced by smaller states and territories. Tasmania, the Northern Territory, and the Australian Capital Territory consistently show lower numbers across all metrics - GDP, exports, educational income, and tourism. This suggests that these regions may need targeted strategies to boost their economic performance, perhaps by identifying and developing niche sectors that can compete effectively with their larger counterparts.</p>
